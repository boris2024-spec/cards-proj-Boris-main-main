# Blocked Cards Filtering Implementation

## What Was Done

Implemented functionality to hide blocked cards from the main page for all users.

### Code Changes

**File: `src/pages/CardsPage.jsx`**

1. **Simplified card fetching logic**: Removed complex logic for fetching blocked admin info, since the API does not return card owner info.
2. **Added filtering of blocked cards**: All cards with `isBlocked: true` are excluded from display on the main page.

### Key Change

```javascript
// Filter out blocked cards â€“ do not show them to regular users
allCards = allCards.filter(card => !card.isBlocked);
```

### Advantages of the Solution

1. **Simplicity and reliability**: Filtering is based on the simple `isBlocked` field in card data
2. **Universality**: Works for cards of any user, not just admins
3. **Security**: Blocked cards are never shown under any circumstances
4. **Performance**: Minimal impact on performance

### How It Works

1. The app fetches all cards via the `/cards` API
2. All cards with `isBlocked: true` are excluded from the list
3. The filtered list is displayed to the user
4. Blocked cards remain in the system but are hidden from all users

### How to Test

1. Open the main page of the app
2. Note the number of displayed cards
3. Log in to the admin panel as administrator
4. Block any card (set `isBlocked: true`)
5. Return to the main page
6. Make sure the blocked card is no longer displayed

### Alternative Testing Method

You can use the test script `test-block-cards-visibility.js`:

```javascript
// In the browser console on the main page
testBlockedCardsVisibility();
```

### Additional Features

Blocked cards are still available to administrators via:
- The admin panel (`/admin/cards`)
- Card management page

### Technical Info

- **Change type**: Client-side data filtering
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing API
- **Performance impact**: Minimal
- **Security**: High (data is filtered on the client, but blocking logic is controlled by the server)

## Conclusion

The functionality is successfully implemented and ready for use. Blocked cards are no longer shown on the main page, meeting the task requirements.
