# ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Hiding Blocked Cards

## 🎯 Goal
Do not show blocked business cards to regular users on the public cards page.

## ✨ Solution
Implemented filtering to exclude all blocked cards (not only admin-owned) on the main cards page.

## 🔧 Technical details

### Files changed:
- `src/pages/CardsPage.jsx` - main filtering logic

### Key code:
```javascript
// Filter out blocked cards - do not show them to regular users
allCards = allCards.filter(card => !card.isBlocked);
```

## 🚀 How it works

1. **Fetch**: The app requests all cards from the `/cards` API
2. **Filter**: All cards with `isBlocked: true` are excluded
3. **Render**: Users see only active business cards

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated testing:
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:5174/`
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Paste/run the code from `test-block-cards-visibility.js`
4. Run: `testBlockedCardsVisibility()`

### Manual testing:
1. **Before blocking**: Visit the main cards page and note the number of cards
2. **Block a card**: Sign in to the admin panel and block any card
3. **After blocking**: Refresh the main page — the blocked card should no longer be visible

## 📊 Result

- ✅ Blocked cards are not displayed on the public cards page
- ✅ Administrators can manage cards through the admin panel
- ✅ Simple and reliable solution
- ✅ Minimal performance impact

## 🔄 Before / After

### Before:
```javascript
// All cards were shown, including blocked ones
setCards(response.data);
```

### After:
```javascript
// Only active cards are shown
allCards = allCards.filter(card => !card.isBlocked);
setCards(allCards);
```

## 🎉 Done!

The feature is implemented and ready to use. Blocked cards are no longer visible on the main page for regular users.
